# Repository Title

## Description
The purpose of this application is to give the user the ability to search for the weather at different cities around the world.  Once a city is submited, it's information will be saved and can be looked at again by clicking on the respective button that is created.  The information and the list of cities will be stored for the entire day, but will have to be started again the next day.  

## Installation
I have already deployed this to a [website](https://bswiley.github.io/Weather-There/) so nothing further needs to be done to get it to work.  A copy of the index is at the same level in the repository as is this README.md file.  Also in the same directory is the following screencapture: ![screencapture](screencapture.png)  

## License
I have chosen the MIT license to allow the free use of the software while also asserting it being used "as is."
